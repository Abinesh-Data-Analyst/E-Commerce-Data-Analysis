# E-Commerce-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes e-commerce sales data to extract key business insights, optimize discount strategies, and improve profitability. Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to uncover patterns in sales, profits, and customer behavior.
